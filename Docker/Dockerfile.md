## 🐳 Sample Dockerfile

We'll analyze this **Node.js application Dockerfile**:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

---

## 🔹 Line-by-Line Explanation

### 1. `FROM node:18`
**Purpose:** Sets the **base image** for your application

**Why This Matters:**
- `node:18` is an official image that comes with **Linux + Node.js v18 + npm** pre-installed
- Your Node.js app needs Node runtime + libraries → instead of manually installing Node on Linux, we reuse this base
- **Alternative:** Without it, you'd need to start from `FROM ubuntu:22.04` and manually `apt-get install nodejs`

**What Happens:**
- Docker downloads the Node.js 18 base image (if not already cached)
- This becomes the foundation layer for your custom image
- Includes operating system, Node.js runtime, npm, and essential libraries

### 2. `WORKDIR /app`
**Purpose:** Sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`

**Why This Matters:**
- It's like running `cd /app` before executing any subsequent commands
- Ensures all following commands (COPY, RUN, CMD) happen inside `/app`
- Creates a consistent, predictable file structure

**What Happens:**
- If `/app` doesn't exist, Docker automatically creates it
- All relative paths in subsequent instructions are relative to `/app`
- Sets the default directory for when you `docker exec` into the container

### 3. `COPY package*.json ./`
**Purpose:** Copies dependency files from local machine → container

**Breaking Down the Syntax:**
- `package*.json` is a **glob pattern** that matches:
  - `package.json`
  - `package-lock.json` (if it exists)
- `./` refers to the current working directory (`/app`)

**Why Copy Dependencies First?**
- **Docker Layer Caching Strategy:**
  - Dependencies don't change as often as source code
  - If `package.json` didn't change, Docker reuses cached `npm install` layer
  - Results in **faster builds** when only code changes

**Performance Impact:**
```
❌ Wrong Order:
COPY . .           # Code changes invalidate cache
RUN npm install    # Reinstalls every time

✅ Correct Order:
COPY package*.json ./  # Only invalidated when deps change  
RUN npm install        # Cached when deps unchanged
COPY . .              # Code changes don't affect deps
```

### 4. `RUN npm install`
**Purpose:** Installs Node.js dependencies inside the container

**Key Differences:**
- `RUN` = executed **during image build** (build-time)
- `CMD` = executed **when container starts** (run-time)

**What Happens:**
- npm reads `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
- Downloads and installs all dependencies into `node_modules/`
- The `node_modules` directory becomes part of the image layer
- This step is cached unless `package*.json` files change

### 5. `COPY . .`
**Purpose:** Copies the rest of your source code from local → container

**Why Separate from package.json Step?**
- **Caching Optimization:**
  - Source code changes frequently
  - Dependencies change infrequently
  - Separating them ensures dependency installation is cached

**What Gets Copied:**
- All files and directories in build context
- Respects `.dockerignore` file (excludes specified patterns)
- Overwrites any existing files in the container

### 6. `EXPOSE 3000`
**Purpose:** Documents that this app will listen on port `3000` inside the container

**Important Misconceptions:**
- `EXPOSE` does **NOT** actually open the port to your host machine
- It's **documentation** telling Docker: "This app uses port 3000 internally"
- **Metaphor:** Like putting a sign on a door, but not actually opening it

**To Actually Access the Port:**
```bash
# Map host port 8080 to container port 3000
docker run -p 8080:3000 myapp

# Now accessible at: http://localhost:8080
```

**Port Mapping Explanation:**
```
Host Machine          Container
localhost:8080   →    app:3000
     ↑                   ↑
  What you        What app
  access in       listens on
  browser         internally
```

### 7. `CMD ["node", "server.js"]`
**Purpose:** Defines the default command to run when container starts

**Command Format:**
- **Exec form:** `CMD ["node", "server.js"]` (recommended)
- **Shell form:** `CMD node server.js`

**Key Differences:**
- `RUN` executes at **build time** (becomes part of image)
- `CMD` executes at **runtime** (when container starts)

**Flexibility:**
```bash
# Uses default CMD
docker run myapp

# Overrides CMD
docker run myapp npm run dev
```

# 🔹 Why We Copy Dependencies Separately (`package*.json`)

## 1. Layer Caching Efficiency

-   Docker builds images in layers (each command = one layer).
-   It checks the inputs of each layer (files, args, environment).
-   If the input hasn't changed → Docker reuses the cached layer.
-   If the input has changed → Docker rebuilds that layer and all layers
    after it.

## 2. Separation of Concerns

-   Dependencies (npm modules) usually change less often than source
    code.
-   Keeping `package*.json` in its own step means dependency
    installation is independent from frequent source changes.

## 3. Build Speed

-   Source code edits → only the later `COPY . .` layer is rebuilt.
-   Dependency installation step (`RUN npm install`) stays cached → much
    faster rebuilds.

## 4. Reduced Network Load

-   `npm install` won't re-download packages unless `package*.json`
    changed.
-   Saves time and bandwidth.

## 5. Predictable Builds

-   Dependencies update only when you explicitly modify `package.json`
    or `package-lock.json`.

# 🔹 How Docker Checks for Changes Before Building a Layer

1.  **Each Dockerfile instruction = one image layer**\
    Example:

    ``` dockerfile
    COPY package*.json ./
    RUN npm install
    COPY . .
    ```

    → That means 3 layers will be created.

2.  **Before building a layer, Docker checks the build cache**

    -   Docker compares the inputs of the current instruction with the
        cache from previous builds.
    -   Inputs include:
        -   The instruction itself (`COPY`, `RUN`, `ENV`, etc.)
        -   The files being copied (and their content checksum)
        -   The build context (files sent to Docker daemon)

3.  **How the comparison works**

    -   Docker generates a checksum (hash) for the instruction + files
        involved.
    -   It then looks at the cache of the last build:
        -   If the checksum matches → cache hit (layer is reused).
        -   If not → cache miss (layer is rebuilt and cache updated).

4.  **Example Flow**

    -   **First build:**

        ``` dockerfile
        COPY package*.json ./   → hash("package.json contents")
        RUN npm install          → executed (fresh install)
        COPY . .                 → hash(all source files)
        ```

        → All layers are built.

    -   **Second build (only server.js changed):**

        -   Docker re-checks `COPY package*.json ./` → checksum
            unchanged → cache hit.
        -   So `RUN npm install` is skipped, layer is reused.
        -   At `COPY . .` → checksum changed (source changed) → cache
            miss → only this layer is rebuilt.

    ✅ That's why dependency caching works so well.

5.  **Why it's powerful**

    -   Docker doesn't compare timestamps or file size.
    -   It compares actual content hashes → very reliable.
    -   That's why even a single line change in `package.json` will
        force re-installation of dependencies.

## 🔹 Build-Time vs Run-Time Commands

### 🏗️ Build Time (Image Creation)
**Commands executed during `docker build`:**

| Instruction | Purpose | When Executed |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| `FROM` | Set base image | Build time |
| `WORKDIR` | Set working directory | Build time |
| `COPY` | Copy files into image | Build time |
| `RUN` | Execute commands in image | Build time |
| `EXPOSE` | Document port usage | Build time (metadata only) |

### 🚀 Run Time (Container Execution)
**Commands/options used during `docker run`:**

| Option/Command | Purpose | When Executed |
|----------------|---------|---------------|
| `CMD` | Default startup command | Runtime |
| `-p` | Port mapping | Runtime |
| `-v` | Volume mounting | Runtime |
| `-e` | Environment variables | Runtime |
| `--name` | Container name | Runtime |

## 🔹 Complete Build Process Flow

### 1. **Build Phase** (`docker build -t myapp .`)

```
Step 1: FROM node:18
 → Pull base image (if not cached)
 → Create first layer

Step 2: WORKDIR /app  
 → Create /app directory
 → Set as working directory

Step 3: COPY package*.json ./
 → Copy dependency files
 → Create new layer with these files

Step 4: RUN npm install
 → Install dependencies
 → Create layer with node_modules/

Step 5: COPY . .
 → Copy source code  
 → Create layer with application files

Step 6: EXPOSE 3000
 → Add metadata (no layer created)

Step 7: CMD ["node", "server.js"]
 → Set default command (no layer created)
```

### 2. **Run Phase** (`docker run -p 8080:3000 myapp`)

```
Container Creation:
 → Create container from final image
 → Assign isolated filesystem
 → Set up networking namespace
 → Map host port 8080 → container port 3000

Container Startup:
 → Execute CMD: node server.js
 → Application starts listening on port 3000
 → Accessible via http://localhost:8080
```

## 🚀 Layer Caching Strategy

### How Docker Caches Layers:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18           # Layer 1: Base image (rarely changes)
WORKDIR /app          # Layer 2: Working directory (never changes)  
COPY package*.json ./ # Layer 3: Dependencies (changes infrequently)
RUN npm install       # Layer 4: Install deps (cached if Layer 3 unchanged)
COPY . .              # Layer 5: Source code (changes frequently)
EXPOSE 3000           # Metadata only
CMD ["node", "server.js"] # Metadata only
```

### Cache Invalidation Rules:
- **If Layer N changes → Layers N+1, N+2, etc. are rebuilt**
- **If Layer N unchanged → Docker reuses cached layer**

### Optimization Example:
```
Build 1 (First time):
✅ All layers built from scratch (5-10 minutes)

Build 2 (Only code changed):  
✅ Layers 1-4 cached (reused instantly)
🔄 Layer 5 rebuilt (30 seconds)

Build 3 (Dependencies changed):
✅ Layers 1-2 cached  
🔄 Layers 3-5 rebuilt (3-5 minutes)
```
